* About.
SafeBNB is an autonomous yield and liquidly generation protocol. SafeBNB generates yield by applying a tax of 6% on every buy and sell transaction while splitting that fee instantly among token holders and the liquidity pool. The protocol rewards its token holders by splitting 4% of each transaction proportionally across existing holders. This means the number of tokens in the holders wallet will increase as people buy and sell as long as tokens are held. In addition 2% goes automatically to the liquidity pool locking forever.

* The Purpose.
The purpose of SafeBNB is to provide a way to earn yield from holding tokens without having to stake or farm. This revolutionary idea could possibly do away with the need to stake or farm coins by locking up token value where it’s not easily accessed and/or having to deal with impermanent loss (something most stakers and LP providers understand too well). SafeBNB provides the upside of staking and farming without the hassles. We also believe that this mechanism provides investors with a golden opportunity and incentive to help SafeBNB grow, due to the fact that higher transaction volume leads to increased fees and rewards for distribution to holders. In this way SafeBNB success is the investors success, as it should be.

* Deflationary.
SafeBNB started with the initial supply of 1,000,000,000,000 tokens. At launch, 50% of the total supply of SafeBNB was sent to a blackhole / burn address permanently reducing the supply. This blackhole address is considered the largest holder of SafeBNB so it also receives a share of each transaction fee. As this share is «burned» it leads to a continuing reduction in the supply of SafeBNB. This also has the effect of locking said value without the possibility of it being withdrawn which increases the general price floor of SafeBNB.
